# covid_prediction
I recently built a project to understand the COVID 19 trend in India to analyse the future outcomes in terms of 30 parameters. 
 It was aimed to analyse what factors help us understand the severity of rising cases and which factors do we need to look at the most. 
 A dataset was provided and we were given specific targets we needed to satisfy in order to mark the project complete. 
 The basic tasks were subsetting just India related values and dropping columns with more than 50% null values, otherwise replacing them with either median or mean where satisfied. 
 We were told to perform exploratory data analysis by creating histograms,scatterplots and lineplots that provided us with the graphical understanding of trends and made it easier for us to derive conclusions.
please see the pdf for better understaning of this project.
thank you.
